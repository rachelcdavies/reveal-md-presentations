# Becoming a conference speaker

Notes: 
I have a lot of experience presenting at conferences.
I learned a lot about this through working as a conference programme reviewer and chair. 
At a previous workplace, I ran a Conference Club to help people there become conference speakers.

Notes:  Passion gives energy to your talk. 
If you speak about something you care about then it comes across to the audience.

## Picking a topic
 
 * What is the last thing you spent more than 15 minute trying to figure out?
 * What is the last tool, process, or code you wrote that made you excited enough to tell somebody else?
 * What was the last question a more junior developer asked you?
 * What do you wish somebody had told you a year ago?

## Seek Feedback

Notes:  Ask someone to read your asbtract. What do they think?
People often miss this step because of deadline

Test out your talk with a live audience. What's their feedback?

## Pair presenting

Notes: for hands-on workshops and talks you can also try presenting with someone else more experienced.

---

## Balancing Topics

![Dinner Party](images/dinner-party.jpg)

Notes: Just like creating a dinner party menu, a conference organisaer wants to create a balanced programme with something to suit eveyone

Conference organisers need to selecta a good balance of sessions. 
They need to satisfy the mainstream of attendees who will be beginners

---

## Research the Event

* Look at programme for past years
* Go along as a participant 
* Read the call for proposals carefully

Notes: there are many conferences out there - academic, community, commercial
Start with community ones. 
Commercial ones tend to be looking more for big names and have bigger speaker budgets so they may be more competition for speakers.
Remember that it has to be an event that you will enjoy attending

## Reviewer Perspective

![boots](images/orange_boots.png)

Notes: Put yourself in the shoes of the reviewer. 
They are typically volunteers reviewing a lot of proposals after work. They have industry experience.
As they are short on time, 
your proposal needs to read well-enough to go in conference programme and connect with their audience.
They may look up your profile and for new speakers some evidence you have given this talk at another event.

---

## Abstract Abstract

* Short catchy title not obscured by humour
* Engaging description of what you will cover
* State experience-level expected for audience
* Include benefits for attending your session
